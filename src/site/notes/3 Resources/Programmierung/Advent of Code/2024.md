[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## How to read my code

My code follows some ideas. First, i have a single main-function inside of [main.rs](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/68c40e3674759806e02bb5041943e0b8a3499148/Rust/adventofcode24/src/main.rs#L15), which handles everything for this aoc year. You can run all days with `cargo run/test -p adventofcode24 ..` inside of `Rust/` folder. Replace `..` with the day you want to run e.g. `6` for day 6. The main-function will take care to run all days in parallel, and provide the results in a structured way, but the days do not be in parallel.

Every day follows the same structure, so it has a single `day`-function which is public and it returns a String with the results for part1 and part2. In the code, this are the entrypoints for you to look for code. See [day1.rs](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/68c40e3674759806e02bb5041943e0b8a3499148/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day1.rs#L94) as an example. Most times, i try to follow the rustacean way to code, so you will see more code in comparison to other solutions.  So if you want to look at the code, you should start with the `part1` or `part2` functions at the bottom of the day-files and start from there your investigation. Do not try to understand the structs at the top of the file first. This will help you to understand, what is going on and why the structs or functions are the way they are.

In most cases the code is not optimized or restructured after finish, so there can be some ugly stuff in it. But mostly it should be readable for rustaceans or for people who want to become one. Sometimes i am trying to implement stuff from `std`-library by myself in context of an aoc day, so do not be too confused, if you see more code then needed.

## Day 1 - Wrapper structures are good for "separation of concerns"

This was a pretty easy and straight forward solution. No hard things to think about. In my solution, i go the hard "rust" parser way with `FromStr`-Trait, but it is a much cleaner implementation. I am using this approach for some AoC now. It helps a lot to split implementation details.

Also, you can find a good use case for wrapper structures in rust. For each step in my implementation i am using a separate structure to make it more cleaner to work with intermediate steps. I implemented `UnsortedLocations`, `SortedLocations` and `SimilarityLocations`. With this approach, you cannot call `get_score` for part2 without the needed steps taken.

## Day 2 - Bruteforce can win, too... sometimes

Okay... Part 1 was easy and not much to talk about. After some time (2 hours...) Part 2, too. But after this 2 hours, i take a different approach as the first one and using the brute force approach. In this 2 hours, i tried to find the smart-boy solution, but there is no such thing for me. The brute force approach is already fine for the sample set. After this lightbulb i got it done very quick. Use your approach for part 1 and remove every element in your array and you are done. Not much to mention or learning from.

## Day 3 - No Regex, more compiler stuff

This day was a little more typing work. On reddit, there was some spoilers about regex. After reading the task, it comes to my mind, that the second part would do something that would break regex and my study of compilers comes closer for my solution. A quick look into my notices and it comes clearer. Now you can see a small lexer and parser (2 step compiler) in my solution. First i parse the text into Items, but do not throw an error on unwanted characters. This will help us later to Parse the logic and runs over the items and handle appropriate.
Some typing work later, part 2 becomes an easy task, which would be much harder with regex. Both parts runs in 647.7µs with release profile, so i am very happy with it. :)

> This was implemented in a previously version: [learning\_tasks/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day3.rs at 92da2670849dd3d20ae1b675ac36d004018a25f3 · Heiss/learning\_tasks · GitHub](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/92da2670849dd3d20ae1b675ac36d004018a25f3/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day3.rs)

For a much closer solution to normal compiler theory, i implemented a much more native and basic lexer and so the parser does not need a window on the iterator anymore. So this could be the starting point for a real compiler or interpreter. [day3.rs](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/develop/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day3.rs#L44) Funny thing: it is mostly, but not exactly as fast as the windows solution, but more generic. The only ugly stuff is, that i repeat myself and that `do` and `don't` are very similar, so they are sharing some code. But no magic needs to be done, except some else-case handling. :)

-later the day: After some scrolling around on reddit-
Okay, regex have also a great and easy solution. But i am not here to do easy things. :) I had fun to implement a small interpreter again. This regex stuff is also very easy, but stands on bright shoulders. So mostly it is an easier approach on the same idea.
Also i am happy to not be the only one, which takes this approach.

## Day 4 - First hard day

Okay, now we are getting serious. This needed some more attention on my side. At the end, the logic is pretty simple, but my first approach was a little bit to biased for [window iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.Windows.html), so i implemented it by myself for 2d-vecs... But this ignored the fact, that a single X can be the starting point for multiple words and that i count the same XMAS twice or more.
So i need a new approach, which looks for X as the starting point. But with the iterator approach, i had a lot work done already and so it was pretty easy to adjust to this. Same thing for the part2, because i took the same approach and looks for the A as the starting point. With a little pattern recognition stuff (and code explosions), this is a pretty good solution, also for other use cases or input.
And i learned how to implement my own iterator and windows in rust. So yeah, it is a win for me.

## Day 5 - HashMap and *invert the logic* to the rescue

Okay, this was the first one which is easy in part 1 and a little bit (i mean, by a lot) harder in part2. Until today, this years was pretty biased for part 1 on my side. part 1 was pretty straight forward and easy going, i inverted the provided logic from the task text with the help of a hashmap and so i can find the numbers in false order pretty fast. After some thought for part 2, skipping the first approach with swapping around the elements or using a power set, i found the approach to sort the vec with a pretty simple [Ordering](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html) with the help of the hashmap, created for part 1. And so... it does not escalated like day 4.

The only thing i rushed today, was the data struct, which are pretty ugly. But i used a wrapper struct for better usability, so i take it as a win.

## Day 6 - When your mass in code hinders you to achieve the goal

What a trip... I worked approx. 12 hours on this one. Not part 1... This was easy and pretty straight forward. Part 2 is easy to understand, but my code was optimized for part 1 and part 2 was incompatible to it, so it got a mass and my debugging was very frustrating. But a sleep later, i got it fixed. Obviously you have to remember, when checking for loops, where the new obstacle was placed. And that it does not get placed on a field, the guard visited already to come to the current position. This 2 conditions was violated by my code. The loop recognition is done via a hashset and a check if the current field can be saved as visited. If this cannot be done, you were there already and so it is a loop.

## Day 7 - A heart between mathematicians and computer scientist

My first approach was to implement a simple power set algorithm with calculating all bits variations and so i can figure out all operation combinations. And after this, calculate all results. This is the brute force stuff with a cool approach to generate the operator sets.
But the mathematician inside of me recognizes pretty fast, that there have to be a "skilled approach" and so i take a sheet of paper and a pen and calculates a little bit... But made a mistake and so got a false result. But after day 6 i looked for a quick win and go back to my first approach.
After got it done, i thought a little bit and saw, that every multiplication has to be a divisor, which needs to be at the right side of numbers. This seems to be the right solution, because if the divisor is not on the right side, it has to be a subtract operation. When no number is on the right side and the left value is not 0, it has to be not true.
And for part 2 it would be better to calculate directly the solutions, instead of generate every combination. Maybe i will find the time to make this happen.

> [!tip] Added on day 8
> After solving day 8, i found the energy to revisit day 7 and try to find the better approach (the first solution takes 44 seconds to complete). So i take a look at the math side of this task. And without any headache, i found out, that concatination is a mathematical function. With this insight, it was easy to write a solution on paper. But... i did not accomplish the same result in Rust. Somewhere was an error inside of my writing. So I took a look into reddit and there was a solution to copy, which works immediatily and so i take this also as a win, because it follows my logic, described above.

## Day 8 - A day for maintenance and frustration

Today was a simple day, but my first approach does not work as expected. So i sit there and try to debug it for several hours. At last i implemented the discret way and this works immediatily. Sad, because my inner mathecian would like to write linear functions and no discret loop stuff.
But okay, it is fast enough.
