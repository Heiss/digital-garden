## Day 1 - Wrapper structures are good for "separation of concerns"

This was a pretty easy and straight forward solution. No hard things to think about. In my solution, i go the hard "rust" parser way with `FromStr`-Trait, but it is a much cleaner implementation. I am using this approach for some AoC now. It helps a lot to split implementation details.

Also, you can find a good use case for wrapper structures in rust ([learning\_tasks/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day1.rs at develop · Heiss/learning\_tasks · GitHub](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/f1fc34b60b3241dac26dbdaf04d22bcbdef8b0c9/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day1.rs#L50)). For each step in my implementation i am using a separate structure to make it more cleaner to work with intermediate steps. I implemented `UnsortedLocations`, `SortedLocations` and `SimilarityLocations`. With this approach, you cannot call `get_score` for part2 without the needed steps taken.

## Day 2 - Bruteforce can win, too... sometimes

Okay... Part 1 was easy and not much to talk about. After some time (2 hours...) Part 2, too. But after this 2 hours, i take a different approach as the first one and using the brute force approach. In this 2 hours, i tried to find the smart-boy solution, but there is no such thing for me. The brute force approach is already fine for the sample set. After this lightbulb i got it done very quick. Use your approach for part 1 and remove every element in your array and you are done. Not much to mention or learning from.

## Day 3 - No Regex, more compiler stuff

This day was a little more typing work. On reddit, there was some spoilers about regex. After reading the task, it comes to my mind, that the second part would do something that would break regex and my study of compilers comes closer for my solution. A quick look into my notices and it comes clearer. Now you can see a small lexer and parser (2 step compiler) in my solution. First i parse the text into Items, but do not throw an error on unwanted characters. This will help us later to Parse the logic and runs over the items and handle appropriate.
Some typing work later, part 2 becomes an easy task, which would be much harder with regex. Both parts runs in 647.7µs with release profile, so i am very happy with it. :)

For a much closer solution to normal compiler theory, i implemented a much more native and basic lexer and so the parser does not need a window on the iterator anymore. So this could be the starting point for a real compiler or interpreter. [learning\_tasks/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day3.rs at develop · Heiss/learning\_tasks · GitHub](https://github.com/Heiss/learning_tasks/blob/develop/Rust/adventofcode24/src/day3.rs#L44) Funny thing: it is mostly, but not exactly as fast as the windows solution, but more generic. The only ugly stuff is, that i repeat myself and that `do` and `don't` are very similar, so they are sharing some code. But no magic needs to be done, except some else-case handling. :)

-later the day: After some scrolling around on reddit-
Okay, regex have also a great and easy solution. But i am not here to do easy things. :) I had fun to implement a small interpreter again. This regex stuff is also very easy, but stands on bright shoulders. So mostly it is an easier approach on the same idea.
Also i am happy to not be the only one, which takes this approach.

## Day 4 - First hard day

Okay, now we are getting serious. This needed some more attention on my side. At the end, the logic is pretty simple, but my first approach was a little bit to biased for [window iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.Windows.html), so i implemented it by myself for 2d-vecs... But this ignored the fact, that a single X can be the starting point for multiple words and that i count the same XMAS twice or more.
So i need a new approach, which looks for X as the starting point. But with the iterator approach, i had a lot work done already and so it was pretty easy to adjust to this. Same thing for the part2, because i took the same approach and looks for the A as the starting point. With a little pattern recognition stuff (and code explosions), this is a pretty good solution, also for other use cases or input.
And i learned how to implement my own iterator and windows in rust. So yeah, it is a win for me.

## Day 5 - HashMap and *invert the logic* to the rescue

Okay, this was the first one which is easy in part 1 and a little bit (i mean, by a lot) harder in part2. Until today, this years was pretty biased for part 1 on my side. part 1 was pretty straight forward and easy going, i inverted the provided logic from the task text with the help of a hashmap and so i can find the numbers in false order pretty fast. After some thought for part 2, skipping the first approach with swapping around the elements or using a power set, i found the approach to sort the vec with a pretty simple [Ordering](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html) with the help of the hashmap, created for part 1. And so... it does not escalated like day 4.

The only thing i rushed today, was the data struct, which are pretty ugly. But i used a wrapper struct for better usability.
