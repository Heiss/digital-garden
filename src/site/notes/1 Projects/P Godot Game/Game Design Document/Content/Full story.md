# Backstory

The story is placed in space in our SOL system in a not specified future.  
The game starts with the menu shown a cubic space station.  

## 100 Years ago

Earth.  
Astrologists recognize a new object in the solarsystem through a new gravity source.  
It disturbs some ecosystems.  
How fortunate, it resolves somehow also the global warming crisis on earth, so the humans are very thankfully for this circumstance.  
They try to communicate with this object, but no answers.  
No signals can penetrate the object and no information can be collected.  
So they calculate their travel route to it, but there is no other option then a 10 years space travel.  

## 20 Years ago

After a lot of discussions and major world problems and war, the humans built ships and every nation sends multiple ships.  
Space race.  
Every nation thinks, there could be new technologies, which can helps to win over the other.  
And after some time, there was a light in the solar system, source: the cube.  
Every ships vanished in a blink of an eye and there are now multiple smaller cubes around the bigger one.  
No communication available.  

## Now

After multiple years, the smaller cubes begin to move around and docks to each other.  
Such cubic structure docks to the big cube, too.  
It seems, that there is activity inside of the smaller cubes.  
Also, the big cube begins to transform though the smaller cubes inside of it begins to move around like a puzzle.  
  
The bigger cubes tests the human beings and as the player progress the levels and story, they recognize they do not want to understand and fit in this world.  
They try to compromise the other cubes.
